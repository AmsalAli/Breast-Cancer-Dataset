# Leveraging Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression and KNN for Predicting Brest Cancer

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting brest cancer using various algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

# About the Dataset

This dataset will be used for training and evaluating classification algorithms in the field of Supervised Machine Learning. The primary objective is to develop a predictive model capable of classifying tumors as either Malignant (M) or Benign (B) based on a variety of input features.

**Total Records:** 569 samples

**Total Features:** 33 columns (including diagnosis and measurement features)

## Class Distribution:

**Benign (B):** 357 instances

**Malignant (M):** 212 instances

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring techniques in classification, feature selection, and model evaluation.
